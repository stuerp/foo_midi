# The number of MIDI channels of the synthesizer. The MIDI standard defines 16 channels, so MIDI hardware is limited to this number. Internally FluidSynth can use more channels which can be mapped to different MIDI sources.
synth.midi-channels 32

# The sample rate of the audio generated by the synthesizer.
synth.sample-rate 96000

# Gain applied to the final output of the synthesizer.
synth.gain 0.8

# Load and unload samples from memory whenever presets are being selected or unselected for a MIDI channel.

# When set to 1 (TRUE) the reverb effects module is activated. Otherwise, no reverb will be added to the output signal. Note that the amount of signal sent to the reverb module depends on the "reverb send" generator defined in the SoundFont.
synth.reverb.active 1
# Sets the amount of reverb damping.
synth.reverb.damp 0.3
# Sets the reverb output amplitude.
synth.reverb.level 0.7
# Sets the room size (i.e. amount of wet) reverb.
synth.reverb.room-size 0.5
# Sets the stereo spread of the reverb signal.
synth.reverb.width 0.8

# When set to 1 (TRUE) the chorus effects module is activated. Otherwise, no chorus will be added to the output signal. Note that the amount of signal sent to the chorus module depends on the "chorus send" generator defined in the SoundFont.
synth.chorus.active 1
# Specifies the modulation depth of the chorus.
synth.chorus.depth 4.25
# Specifies the output amplitude of the chorus signal.
synth.chorus.level 0.6
# Sets the voice count of the chorus.
synth.chorus.nr 3
# Sets the modulation speed in Hz.
synth.chorus.speed 0.2

# Defines how many voices can be played in parallel.
synth.polyphony 512

# Defines how the synthesizer interprets Bank Select messages.
#
#   gs: (default) CC0 becomes the bank number, CC32 is ignored.
#   gm: ignores CC0 and CC32 messages.
#   mma: bank is calculated as CC0*128+CC32.
#   xg: If CC0 is equal to 120, 126, or 127 then channel is set to drum and the bank number is set to 128 (CC32 is ignored). Otherwise the channel is set to melodic and CC32 is the bank number.
