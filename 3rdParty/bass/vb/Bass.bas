' NOTE: VB does not support 64-bit integers, so VB users only have access
'       to the low 32-bits of 64-bit return values. 64-bit parameters can
'       be specified though, using the "64" version of the function.

' NOTE: Use "StrPtr(filename)" to pass a filename to the BASS_MusicLoad,
'       BASS_SampleLoad and BASS_StreamCreateFile functions.

' NOTE: Use the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert "char *" to VB "String".
