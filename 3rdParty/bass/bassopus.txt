What's the point?
=================
BASSOPUS is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
Opus encoded files and streams.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.


Using BASSOPUS
==============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add Opus support to
the standard BASS stream (and sample) creation functions. Dedicated Opus
stream creation functions are also provided by BASSOPUS.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSOPUS and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSOPUS.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSOPUS documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSOPUS & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
