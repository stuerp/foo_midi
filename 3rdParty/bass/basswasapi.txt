NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSWASAPI.DLL and
      BASS.DLL and BASSMIX.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS and BASSmix APIs
      into the same directory as the BASSWASAPI API.


What's the point?
=================
BASSWASAPI is an extension to the BASS audio library, providing the ability
to use WASAPI output and input on Windows Vista and beyond. Both exclusive
and shared WASAPI modes are supported, as are both WASAPI's regular and
event-driven buffering systems.


Requirements
============
Windows Vista or above is required; BASSWASAPI will load on older Windows,
but it will not function. BASS (version 2.4.11 or above) is also required,
and the BASSmix add-on is recommended for resampling and mixing purposes.


Using BASSWASAPI
================
The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSWASAPI and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSWASAPI.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the
     BASS.CHM file, so that the BASSWASAPI documentation can be accessed
     from within the BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest version of BASSWASAPI can always be found at the BASS website:
