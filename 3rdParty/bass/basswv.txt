What's the point?
=================
BASSWV is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
WavPack encoded files.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required. The BASSDSD add-on can also be used to add support for
WavPack DSD files.


Using BASSWV
============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add WavPack support to
the standard BASS stream (and sample) creation functions. Dedicated WavPack
stream creation functions are also provided by BASSWV.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSWV and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSWV.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSWV documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.
