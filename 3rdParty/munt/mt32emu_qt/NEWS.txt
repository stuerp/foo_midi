HEAD:

	* Added mode "Hide to tray on close". When enabled, the application does not exit when the user closes the main window.
	  To exit the application, the corresponding menu items can be used in menu "Tools" and the tray icon menu.

2017-12-25:

	1.7.1 released.

	* Improved layout of partial state LEDs when maximum number of partials is set bigger than 63.
	* Fixed partial state LED widgets being not updated upon a change of Max Partials option.
	  This may also have resulted in crashes.

2017-12-25:

	1.7.0 released.

	* Replaced application icon for mt32emu-qt with a new nicer one.
	* Fixed a few minor bugs in MIDI player dialog.
	* Fixed various issues with accessing files with localised pathnames.
	* Improved timing accuracy of realtime rendering.
	* Added experimental support for Windows 9x platform. As a side effect, Qt version 4.5.3 is now supported.
	* Added new option "Max Partials" in synth configuration. It allows setting the maximum number of partials
	  playing simultaneously.

2017-07-29:

	1.6.0 released.

	* Improved a bit the LCD emulation to better match behaviour of old MT-32 units.
	* Improved synth profile handling. When a non-default synth profile is selected in the synth properties dialog,
	  it is now used during synth re-opening (provided that it is pinned or an active MIDI session persists).
	* Added support for SysEx fragments in standard MIDI files played using the internal MIDI player.
	* Added option "Nice Amp Ramp" in the Synth Properties dialog.
	* Improved "Standard MIDI file converter" dialog:
	  - PCM targets are now automatically named, the path names are based on the most recent directory specified;
	  - added possibility to quickly configure a group of MIDI files to convert to a PCM per file (with an accompanying SysEx);
	  - added "Edit PCM" button to allow renaming the currently selected PCM target;
	  - added "Add init to all" button that allows to quickly prepend a group of MIDI files with an initialisation SysEx/MIDI.
	  - Improved Drag & Drop handling:
	    - directory drops are now supported;
	    - drops outside the "Source MIDI files" list now create a group;
	    - when directories are dropped, SysEx files precede the rest within each directory;
	    - drops inside the "Source MIDI files" list are position-aware.
	* Improved "MIDI Player" dialog:
	  - dialog title now shows the name of the currently playing file or when playback is stopped, the file scheduled
	    for playing;
	  - clicking the "Play" button now ignores the currently selected item in the playlist,
	    instead, the file scheduled for playing is considered;
	  - pressing Enter or double-clicking (depends on platform) an item in the playlist still starts playback with this item;
	  - currently playing item now persists after most of playlist edits, except when it is removed from the list.
	    In this case, playback finishes after that item.
	  - Improved Drag & Drop handling:
	    - when directories are dropped, SysEx files precede the rest within each directory;
	    - drops inside the playlist are now position-aware.

2017-04-09:

	1.5.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.1.0.
	* Moved sample rate conversion feature from mt32emu-qt to the libmt32emu, so it can be easily used in other applications.
	* Added an option to select the renderer type in the synth properties (preserved in the profile).

2016-10-22:

	1.4.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.0.0.
	* Added support of ALSA raw MIDI ports in ALSA MIDI driver. Configuration option mt32emu-qt_WITH_ALSA_MIDI_DRIVER
	  renamed to mt32emu-qt_WITH_ALSA_MIDI_SEQUENCER for consistency, and is now set to TRUE by default on Linux systems only.
	* Added handling of fragmented SysExes in ALSA MIDI driver.
	* Improved CoreAudio driver: CoreAudioStream no longer renders data in the GUI thread, a dedicated internal AudioQueue thread is used instead.
	* Improved MIDI timing calculations. Introduced MIDI latency autodetection mode (initiated by setting MIDI latency to 0).
	* Added build option mt32emu-qt_WITH_DEBUG_WINCONSOLE. It controls whether a debugging console is shown on Windows.
	* Fixed a bug in LinearResampler that may cause incorrect output at beginning of each audio block.
	* Introduced full-featured internal resampler. The intention is to make resampling less demanding than libsamplerate requires
	  yet to reduce the processing delay libsoxr introduces. That's achieved by taking advantage of oversampled output produced
	  by analog circuit emulation engine and using efficient elliptic low-pass filter instead of FFT-based FIR.
	* Added build option mt32emu-qt_WITH_INTERNAL_RESAMPLER. It controls whether to use internal resampler or try to find an external library.
	* Added support for Qt5.
	* Improved support for 64-bit Windows.
	* Improved support for Cygwin, enabled native Windows MIDI and wave audio API.
	* Improved LCD emulation: when setting standard patches, proper sound group name is shown.
	* Introduced pause function in MIDI player for convenience.
	* Introduced a possibility to synchronously record audio output from a synth to a file along while listening.
	* About window now shows target arch and used version of Qt library.

2014-12-21:

	1.3.0 released.

	* Fixed incorrect handling of some rarely used control messages in ALSA MIDI driver.
	* Added support for using different sample rates in audio drivers using sample rate conversion.
	  It is still preferable to use default sample rate of MT-32 emulation engine and sample rate conversion
	  should only be used if a different sample rate is necessary (e.g. audio system doesn't support 32000 Hz) or deliberate.
	  For best performance, libsoxr is supported. Libsamplerate is also supported as it is widely available.
	  As a worst case, the integrated linear interpolator can be used (it's fast but the quality...).
	* Added a new combo box into the Synth Properties dialog that allows to choose analogue circuits emulation method.
	* Added CoreAudio driver for OS X. Portaudio is no longer required for OS X builds.
	* AlsaAudioDriver made more resistant to possible errors and trying to recover before giving up.
	* Incorporated MidiStreamParser class from libmt32emu. This fixes long standing issue with Windows MIDI driver
	  and MIDI-in port handler that prevented receiving SysEx fragments or multi-SysEx packets sent in a single buffer.
	  Windows MIDI driver also supports running status for short messages now. OSS MIDI and CoreMIDI drivers also improved by this.
	* AudioFileWriter now always produces .WAV files in little endian and .RAW files in big endian which corresponds to smf2wav behaviour.
	* Audio drivers for CoreAudio, ALSA and PulseAudio made compatible with big endian systems.
	* Improved command line in handling. Added new options "-profile" and "-max_sessions". Added short help regarding command line syntax.
	* Minor improvements in handling of synth profiles and ROM sets.
	* Added an option in synth properties to use alternative channel assignment automatically on opening a synth.

2014-06-09:

	1.2.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 1.4.0.
	* Added support for reverb model compatibility settings.
	* Fixed a few minor bugs related to reverb and output gains.
	* Added two convenience buttons in synth properties dialog to allow resetting MIDI channel assignment easily.
	* Improved build:
	  - added build option mt32emu-qt_WITH_ALSA_MIDI_DRIVER to control
	    whether to use ALSA MIDI driver (if enabled, ALSA MIDI sequencer
	    ABI is used to communicate with other applications, otherwise,
	    ALSA/OSS4 raw MIDI ports and OSS sequencer ABI are available);
	  - OSS MIDI driver no longer compiles if it isn't needed.
	* Fixed a bug in Windows MME audio driver introduced in version 1.1.0:
	  resetting the synth no longer cause stopping generation of audio output.
	* When ALSA MIDI driver is used, ALSA MIDI port being listened is now displayed in the main window title.
	* Fixed inconsistent ALSA MIDI port advertisement. ALSA MIDI driver now advertises the port
	  as SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_GENERIC, SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_MT32 and SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_SYNTHESIZER.
	* When loading PulseAudio library dynamically, a library name with the major version number appended is tried first.
	  This allows PulseAudio to be loaded without installing the corresponding dev package, which only contains a versionless link
	  to the library shared object in major Linux/GNU distributions.

2013-09-21:

	1.1.0 released.

	* Updated for compatibility with new library v.1.3.0 API. Reworked rendering engine to make use of library internal MIDI event queue.
	* Removed sysex length limit set in the internal MIDI player and converter.
	* Added reverse stereo option to the synth properties dialog.
	* Improved ClockSync class for providing better timing accuracy yet being more robust.
	* Improved timing accuracy in the "advanced timing" mode.
	* Improved QtAudioDriver. Fixed sound dropouts which may occur when using GUI.
	* MIDI player now sends "Reset all controllers" MIDI events when it stops playing.
	* MIDI file converter now removes leading silence. MIDI conversion dialog now guesses PCM output file name if the user adds MIDI file first.
	* Eliminated application hangs on Windows when the application is closed enforcedly,
	  e.g. when the user closes the application console or shuts down the system.
	* Fixed deadlock which may happen when the user quickly pushes "Play" button in the MIDI player.
	* Improved ROM configuration. Added support for default ROM search path which is a directory "roms" located
	  in the current user home directory.
	* Reworked synth visualisation in order to make our LCD model close the hardware behaviour.
	  Added emulation of the "MIDI MESSAGE" led.
	* Fixed display of timbre names which contain null characters.
	* MIDI files can now be dropped to main window and MIDI file converter dialog.
	* Main window now restores its geometry when the application starts. Fixed main window geometry when synth details panel changes visibility.
	* Overall UI layout made more compact. Other UI improvements.
	* Improved build under POSIX environment.
	* ALSA driver can now open "sysdefault" device in order to easily bypass Pulse-ALSA plugin. It can also open "plug:hw" device in exclusive mode
	  to achieve minimal latency.
	* Code refactoring.
