# foo_midi

[foo_midi](https://github.com/stuerp/foo_midi/releases) is a [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) component that adds playback of MIDI files to foobar2000.

It is based on [foo_midi](https://gitlab.com/kode54/foo_midi) by [kode54](https://gitlab.com/kode54).

## Features

* Decodes General MIDI files (.MID, .MIDI, .RMI, .KAR) and several MIDI based formats. (.MIDS, .MDS, .HMI, .HMP, .MUS, .XMI, .LDS).
* Supports several synthesizers, several of which do not require any additional files to play back music. The bundled synthesizers which do not require additional files may sound rather basic, though.
* Supports FluidSynth SoundFont (.sf2) based synthesizer, including support for the newer compressed format. (.sf3). SoundFonts may be loaded in a simple, or even complex setup, using either basic .sflist text files encoded in UTF-8 format, but for now, it only supports a bare list of files.
* Supports 32 and 64-bit VST instruments.
* Supports dark mode.

* Compatible with foobar2000 1.6.13 and foobar2000 2.0 or later (32 and 64-bit version).

## Requirements

* Tested on Microsoft Windows 10 or later.
* [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/download) v1.6.13 or later. ![foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/button-small.png)

## Getting started

* Double-click `foo_midi.fbk2-component`.

or

* Import `foo_midi.fbk2-component` into foobar2000 using "File / Preferences / Components / Install...".

## Developing

The code builds out-of-the box with Visual Studio.

### Requirements

To build the code:

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [foobar2000 SDK](https://www.foobar2000.org/SDK)
* [Windows Template Library (WTL)](https://github.com/Win32-WTL/WTL) 10.0.10320

To create the deployment package:

* [PowerShell 7.2](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

### Setup

        WTL10_10320
    bin
        x86
    foo_midi
    out
    sdk

* `3rdParty/WTL10_10320` contains WTL 10.0.10320.
* `bin` contains a portable version of foobar2000 64-bit for debugging purposes.
* `bin/x86` contains a portable version of foobar2000 32-bit for debugging purposes.
