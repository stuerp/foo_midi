- Version is now 1.221

2013-10-19 02:05 UTC - kode54

- Added support for extended SFList preset overrides. To use, precede any line of an
  .sflist file with a vertical bar "|" and fill in a list of commands, separated into
  groups by ampersand "&" characters. Each group may contain one preset "p" command
  and any number of non-overlapping channel "c" commands. The preset command is of
  the format "p[#,]#=[#,]#", where the four parameters, left to right, are destination
  bank, destination program, source bank, source program. The either of the bank
  numbers is optional, and the default will map all banks, or map to the default bank.
  The channel command is of the format "c#", where the one parameter is a channel
  number in the range of 1-48. The channel command is implemented by routing the paired
  programs, or all programs in the bank if none is specified, to the bank LSB of the
  channels' numbers. Thus, playback through the BASSMIDI driver ignores bank LSB
  commands in the actual files. If anyone can suggest a better way to do this, or ask
  Ian Luck to further extend the BASS_MIDI_FONTEX structure with a channel bitfield,
  be my guest.
