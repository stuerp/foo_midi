## Introduction

Welcome to [foo_midi](https://github.com/stuerp/foo_midi/releases), a [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) component that adds playback of MIDI files to foobar2000. It's based on [foo_midi](https://gitlab.com/kode54/foo_midi) by [kode54](https://gitlab.com/kode54).

This guide will help you understand how to use the product effectively and get the most out of its features.

---

- Tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and later.
- To use FluidSynth you need to [download](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/) and install the latest libraries from its GitHub page.

### Installation

- Double-click `foo_midi.fbk2-component` or import `foo_midi.fbk2-component` into foobar2000 using the "*File / Preferences / Components / Install...*" menu item.
