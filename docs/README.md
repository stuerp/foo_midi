### Players

foo_midi implements and suports several players. A player is emulates an FM or sample-based synthesizer. The build-in players do not require you to download and install any additional files to play back music. Additional players become available when you install and configure the required support files.

### LibADLMIDI (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [libADLMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI) library by [Vitaly Novichkov](https://github.com/Wohlstand) to emulate the [Yamaha YMF262 and CT1747 (OPL3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3) FM synthesis sound chip.

### LibEDMIDI aka Emu de MIDI (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [libEDMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libEDMIDI) library by [Vitaly Novichkov](https://github.com/Wohlstand) to emulate the [Yamaha YM2413 and VRC7 (OPLL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2413) FM synthesis sound chip, the [Sega Programmable Sound Generator (PSG, SN76496)](https://segaretro.org/SN76489) and the [Konami SCC](http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/tech/scc).

It requires you to specify the location of the MT-32 or CM-32L PCM and control ROMS on the **MIDI Player / Paths** preferences page.

### Nuked OPL3 (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [Nuked OPL3](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-OPL3) library by [Alexey Khokholov (Nuke.YKT)](http://nukeykt.retrohost.net/) to emulate the [Yamaha YMF262 and CT1747 (OPL3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3) FM synthesis sound chip.

### LibMT32EMU (MT-32) (Built-in)

This player uses the [libMT32Emu](https://github.com/munt/munt) library to emulated the [Roland MT-32, CM-32L and LAPC-I synthesiser modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32).

### FMMIDI (yuno) (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

[FMMIDI](https://web.archive.org/web/20120823072908/http://milkpot.sakura.ne.jp/fmmidi/index.html) emulates the [Yamaha YM2608 (OPNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2608) FM synthesis sound chip.

It requires a text file that specifies the programs or instrument definitions. A default **Programs.txt** file is installed with the component in component directory. This file can be overriden by selecting a different one on the **MIDI Player / Paths** preferences page.

### BASSMIDI (Built-in)

This player is a wrapper for the BASSMIDI library by [Un4seen](https://www.un4seen.com/). The required libraries to use it are included with the component.

It requires an SF2, SF2Pack, SFZ or SF3 soundfont to provide the instrument samples. See [Sound Fonts](#sound-fonts).

A custom SFList format is also supported to further tweak the sound fonts and instruments used during playback.

### FluidSynth (Optional)

This player is a wrapper for the [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/) library. You need to download the libraries from [GitHub](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/) and configure their path the Preferences dialog to use it.

It requires an SF2, SF2Pack, SFZ or SF3 soundfont or a DLS-compatible wave set to provide the instrument samples. See [Sound Fonts](#sound-fonts).

### Secret Sauce (Optional)

Secret Sauce is a wrapper for the SCCore.dll that comes bundled with Roland’s [Sound Canvas VA](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_sound_canvas_va/).

### VSTi (VST Instruments) (Optional)

Supports 32 and 64-bit VST instruments.

### CLAP (Optional)

The CLAP player allows you to use [CLAP ((CLever Audio Plug-in API))](https://u-he.com/community/clap/) plug-ins to render the audio stream. The plug-in must meet a few requirements:

- Implement the Note Ports and Audio Ports extension.
- Have only 1 MIDI input port and no MIDI output ports.
- Support MIDI dialect.
- Have no audio input ports and only 1 audio output port.
- Have only 2 output channels in stereo configuration.

You must specify the directory that foo_midi will scan to look for on the **MIDI Player / Paths** page. All files with extension .dll or .clap are examined. A CLAP plug-in file can contain multiple plug-ins.

Here are some examples of CLAP plug-ins:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) | Plug-in modeled on the [Yamaha DX7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7) | ![Working](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-green) |

## Playing files

To play a supported MIDI file simply add it to foobar2000 playlist and press play.

If the file format is not supported or there's an error in the file an error message will appear in the Playback Error popup and in the foobar2000 console.

### Configuring the output

By default the [LibADLMIDI (Built-in)](#libadlmidi-built-in) player is used. You can change the player on the **Playback / Decoding / MIDI Player** page of the foobar2000 Preferences. The **Player** droplist contains all available players.

If you have configured VSTi the compatible instruments will added to the list as a player prefixed with *VSTi*.

The **Configure** button will be enabled if the player has an additional dialog to configure settings specific to that player.

The **Sample rate** combobox allows you to specify the sample rate the player will use create samples. Select any of the predefined values or enter a custom value between 6000Hz and 192000Hz.

### Looping

Some MIDI files contain markers to specify which part of the message stream can be played in a loop. These markers are not part of the Standard MIDI Format standard. If the file does not contain markers foo_midi can also play the entire file in a loop.

The following loop markers are supported:

| Name | Description|
| --- | --- |
| EMIDI / XMI | Used by [EMIDI / XMI](http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/XMI_Format#MIDI_controller_assignments) files with Control Change 116 and 117 as loop markers. This format also can specify the number of times the sequence should be looped. |
| Final Fantasy | Used by Final Fantasy files (starting with [Final Fantasy VII](http://www.midishrine.com/index.php?id=85)) with "loopStart" en "loopEnd" meta events as a marker |
| LeapFrog | Used by [LeapFrog](https://leapfrog.fandom.com/wiki/The_Leap-font_(Music)) files with Control Change 110 and 111 |
| RPG Maker | Used by [RPG Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker) files. Control Change 111 marks the loop start. The loop end is always the end of the stream. |
| Touhou | Used by [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) files with Control Change 2 and 4 |

The component supports 6 loop modes that can be selected in the foobar2000 Preferences dialog:

| Type                            | Description |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Never loop                      | The song will be played once ignoring any loop information. |
| Never loop. Use decay time      | The song will be played once ignoring any loop information with a customizable decay period at the end for the sound to die down. |
| Loop and fade when detected     | The song will be played and any defined loop will be repeated a customizable number of times (defined in Advanced Preferences by **Loop count**). At the end of the last loop the song will fade out over the period defined by the **Fade time** settings in Advanced Preferences. |
| Loop and fade always            | The song will be played and looped a customizable number of times (defined in Advanced Preferences by **Loop count**). At the end of the last loop the song will fade out over the period defined by the **Fade time** settings in Advanced Preferences. |
| Play indefinitely when detected | The song will be played and the loop, when detected, will play until stopped. |
| Play indefinitely               | The song will be played and loop until stopped. |

The **Playback** droplist specifies how loops are processed during normal playback. The **Other** droplist determines how loops are processed during other foobar2000 operations such as converting a MIDI file to another format.

The **Decay time** setting specifies the time in milliseconds that the player will wait before starting to play another track. This allows the last MIDI notes of a stream to decay instead of being abruptly cut when the new track starts playing.
