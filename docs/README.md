### Players

foo_midi implements and suports several players. A player is emulates an FM or sample-based synthesizer. The build-in players do not require you to download and install any additional files to play back music. Additional players become available when you install and configure the required support files.

### LibADLMIDI (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [libADLMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI) library by [Vitaly Novichkov](https://github.com/Wohlstand) to emulate the [Yamaha YM3812 (OPL2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL2) and the [Yamaha YMF262 and CT1747 (OPL3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3) FM synthesis sound chip.

It can be configured on the **[MIDI Player / FM Synthesis](#fm-synthesis)** preferences page. Here's an explanation of the available settings:

#### ADL Bank

The library provides many built-in FM patches from various known PC games using AIL (Miles Sound System), DMX, HMI (Human Machine Interfaces) or Creative IBK (Instrument Bank). With this setting you select the bank that will be used during playback.

#### ADL Emulator Core

To render the MIDI file a synthesizer chip is emulated. These are the eumlators that the current version of the library supports:

| Name              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Nuked OPL3 v1.8   | Slowest but most accurate |
| Nuked OPL3 v1.7.4 | Slow, slightly less accurate |
| DOSBox            | Fast, mostly accurate |
| Opal OPL3         | Only suitable for Reality Adlib Tracker tunes |
| Java OPL3         | Written by Robson Cozendey |
| ESFMu             | [ESS ESFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#ESS_ESFM), an enhanced 72-operator OPL3-compatible clone, written by [Nuke.YKT](https://github.com/nukeykt) and [Kagamiin~](https://github.com/Kagamiin) |
| MAME OPL2         | Written by Jarek Burczynski and Tatsuyuki Satoh |
| YMFM OPL2         | Written by Aaron Giles |
| YMFM OPL3         | Written by Aaron Giles |
| Nuked OPL2 LLE    | Low-Level Emulator, CPU heavy |
| Nuked OPL3 LLE    | Low-Level Emulator, CPU heavy |

#### ADL Chips

You can specify the number of chips (1 to 100) that are available to the player. Emulation of multiple chips extends polyphony limits when rendering a MIDI file.

#### ADL Soft panning

Enables or disables soft panning.

By default the library uses binary panning where a sound is either fully left, fully right, or center. It's a simple on/off stereo placement.

Soft panning (also called full-panning stereo) allows for gradual placement of sound across the stereo field, enabling smoother and more realistic spatial positioning of instruments.

#### ADL Bank File

A bank can be loaded from a file in the [WOPL format](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor/blob/master/Specifications/WOPL-and-OPLI-Specification.pdf). You can create a bank using Wohlstand's [OPL3 Bank Editor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor). The loaded bank will take precendence over the select bank.

### LibOPNMIDI (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [libOPNMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libOPNMIDI) library by [Vitaly Novichkov](https://github.com/Wohlstand) to emulate the [Yamaha YM2612 (OPN2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2612) and [Yamaha YM2608 (OPNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2608) FM synthesis sound chip.

It can be configured on the **[MIDI Player / FM Synthesis](#fm-synthesis)** preferences page. Here's an explanation of the available settings:

#### OPN Bank

The library provides a couple of instrument banks. With this setting you select the bank that will be used during playback.

#### OPN Emulator Core

To render the MIDI file a synthesizer chip is emulated. These are the eumlators that the current version of the library supports:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| MAME&nbsp;YM2612 | Accurate and fast on slow devices |
| MAME&nbsp;YM2608 | Accurate and fast on slow devices |
| Nuked&nbsp;OPN2&nbsp;([YM3438](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YM3438#Yamaha_YM3438) mode) | Very accurate, requires a powerful CPU |
| Nuked&nbsp;OPN2&nbsp;(YM2612&nbsp;mode) | Very accurate, requires a powerful CPU |
| Gens/GS&nbsp;II&nbsp;OPN2 | GENS 2.10 emulator. Very outdated and inaccurate, but fastest. |
| Neko&nbsp;Project&nbsp;II&nbsp;Kai&nbsp;OPNA | Neko Project 2 YM2608 emulator. Semi-accurate, but fast on slow devices. |
| YMFM&nbsp;OPN2 | [YMFM emulators](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) written by Aaron Giles |
| YMFM&nbsp;OPNA | [YMFM emulators](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) written by Aaron Giles |

The following emulator cores have been deprecated in the current version of the library and are no longer available:

- [Genesis Plus GX](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX)
- [PMDWin](https://c60.la.coocan.jp/) OPNA

#### OPN Chips

You can specify the number of chips (1 to 100) that are available to the player. Emulation of multiple chips extends polyphony limits when rendering a MIDI file.

#### OPN Soft panning

Enables or disables soft panning.

By default the library uses binary panning where a sound is either fully left, fully right, or center. It's a simple on/off stereo placement.

#### OPN Bank File

A bank can be loaded from a file in the [WOPN format](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPN2BankEditor/blob/master/Specifications/WOPN-and-OPNI-Specification.txt). You can create a bank using Wohlstand's [OPN2 Bank Editor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPN2BankEditor). The loaded bank will take precendence over the select bank.

### LibEDMIDI aka Emu de MIDI (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [libEDMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libEDMIDI) library by [Vitaly Novichkov](https://github.com/Wohlstand) to emulate the [Yamaha YM2413 and VRC7 (OPLL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2413) FM synthesis sound chip, the [Sega Programmable Sound Generator (PSG, SN76496)](https://segaretro.org/SN76489) and the [Konami SCC](http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/tech/scc).

### Nuked OPL3 (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

This player uses the [Nuked OPL3](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-OPL3) library by [Alexey Khokholov (Nuke.YKT)](http://nukeykt.retrohost.net/) to emulate the [Yamaha YMF262 and CT1747 (OPL3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3) FM synthesis sound chip.

### LibMT32EMU (MT-32) (Built-in, FM Synthesis / Wavetable)

This player uses the [LibMT32Emu](https://github.com/munt/munt) library to emulate the [Roland MT-32, CM-32L and LAPC-I synthesiser modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32).

> [!Important]
> You have to specify the location of the MT-32 or CM-32L PCM and control ROMS on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page before you can use this player.

It can be configured on the **[MIDI Player / FM Synthesis](#fm-synthesis)** preferences page. Here's an explanation of the available settings:

#### Resampling

Determines the quality of the sample rate conversion: Fastest, Fast, Good or Best.

#### Max. Partials

Allows you to override the maximum number of partials playing simultaneously within the emulation session.

> In the MT-32's Linear Arithmetic (LA) synthesis, each tone is made up of up to four partials. These partials can be PCM samples or synthesized waveforms, and they are mixed together to form a complete sound.

#### Analog Output Mode

The original MT-32 had analog components (like filters and amplifiers) that subtly colored the sound. This setting affects the final coloration and warmth of the sound, especially when aiming for an authentic retro audio experience.

It is especially important if you're trying to replicate the exact sound of classic DOS games or MIDI compositions as they were heard in the late '80s and early '90s.

| Name     | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Digital&nbsp;Only | Only the digital path is emulated. The output samples correspond to the digital signal at the DAC entrance. |
| Coarse       | Coarse emulation of the LPF circuit. High frequencies are boosted, sample rate remains unchanged. |
| Accurate     | Finer emulation of the LPF circuit. Output signal is upsampled to 48 kHz to allow emulation of audible mirror spectra above 16 kHz, * which is passed through the LPF circuit without significant attenuation. |
| Oversampled  | Same as Accurate but the output signal is 2x oversampled, i.e. the output sample rate is 96 kHz. This makes subsequent resampling easier. Besides, due to nonlinear passband of the LPF emulated, it takes fewer number of MACs  compared to a regular LPF FIR implementations. |

#### DAC Input Mode

The DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) in the original MT-32 had specific limitations and nonlinearities.

The library emulates this behavior, and the DAC Input Mode determines how audio is prepared before it's "sent" to the virtual DAC.

| Name         | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Nice         | Produces samples at double the volume, without tricks. Higher quality than the real devices. |
| Pure         | Produces samples that exactly match the bits output from the emulated LA32. Much less likely to overdrive than any other mode. Half the volume of any of the other modes. |
| Generation&nbsp;1 | Re-orders the LA32 output bits as in early generation MT-32s. |
| Generation&nbsp;2 | Re-orders the LA32 output bits as in later generations MT-32s. |

#### Reverb

Enables or disable reverb generation.

#### Nice Amp Ramp

On real Roland MT-32 hardware, sudden changes in volume or expression can cause abrupt "jumps" in amplitude. This setting makes these changes gradual, resulting in a more natural and musical sound. This is particularly useful when MIDI tracks include quick volume fades or expression shifts.

> [!Note]
> This is a quality improvement that sacrifices emulation accuracy.

#### Nice Panning

The original MT-32 had some idiosyncrasies in how it handled panning. This feature mimics those subtleties for a more authentic sound. Instead of abrupt left/right shifts when a MIDI track changes pan values, "Nice Panning" makes these transitions more gradual and natural. Instruments sound more like they're moving across a stereo field, rather than jumping from one side to the other.

#### Nice Partial Mixing

The original MT-32 had subtle nonlinearities and quirks in how it mixed partials. This setting mimics those characteristics. It ensures that the partials are mixed in a way that avoids harsh digital artifacts or unnatural volume spikes.
Especially noticeable in complex tones like orchestral instruments or layered synths, where multiple partials interact.

#### Reverse Stereo

Early MT-32 units (especially those with ROM version 1.07 or earlier) are known to have reversed stereo channels compared to modern expectations.

Enable this setting to reverse the channels.

#### GM Set

Determines which General MIDI configuration is used by the player: Roland or King's Quest 6.

### FMMIDI (yuno) (Built-in, FM Synthesis)

[FMMIDI](https://web.archive.org/web/20120823072908/http://milkpot.sakura.ne.jp/fmmidi/index.html) emulates the [Yamaha YM2608 (OPNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2608) FM synthesis sound chip.

> [!Important]
> It requires a text file that specifies the programs or instrument definitions. A default **Programs.txt** file is installed with the component in component directory. This file can be overriden by selecting a different one on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page.

### BASSMIDI (Built-in, Wavetable)

This player is a wrapper for the BASSMIDI library by [Un4seen](https://www.un4seen.com/). The required libraries to use it are included with the component.

It requires an SF2, SF2Pack or SFZ soundfont to provide the instrument samples. See [Soundfonts](#soundfonts).

A custom SFList format is also supported to further tweak the soundfonts and instruments used during playback.

### FluidSynth (Optional, Wavetable)

This player is a wrapper for the [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/) library.

It requires an SF2, SF2Pack, SFZ or SF3 soundfont or a DLS-compatible wave set to provide the instrument samples. See [Soundfonts](#soundfonts).

> [!Important]
> You need to download the libraries from [GitHub](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/) and configure their path on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page before FluidSynth becomes available as a player.

#### Configuration file

You can use a text file to specify FluidSynth settings. The file must have the following format:

- Empty lines and comment lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
- Each line contains one setting in the following format: `name` *spaces* `value`.
- Settings with invalid values are ignored.
- Any valid setting will override the foo_midi defaults and the values set in the Preferences.

Refer to [FluidSettings](https://www.fluidsynth.org/api/fluidsettings.xml) for the available settings.

Specify the path to the file on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page. An example file is included in the component directory.

### Secret Sauce (Optional)

Secret Sauce is a wrapper for the SCCore.dll that comes bundled with Roland’s [Sound Canvas VA](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_sound_canvas_va/).

> [!Important]
> You need to specify the path of the SCCore.dll on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page before Secret Sauce becomes available as a player.

### VSTi (VST Instruments) (Optional)

[Virtual Studio Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsti) (VST&reg;) instruments are plug-ins that provide extra functionality to a digital audio workstation (DAW). foo_midi can use both 32 and 64-bit VST instruments that are virtual  synthesizers.

> [!Important]
> You need to specify location of the VSTi plug-ins on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page. Any compatible plug-in will be added to the player list with a `VSTi` prefix.

### CLAP (Optional)

The CLAP player allows you to use [CLAP (CLever Audio Plug-in API)](https://u-he.com/community/clap/) plug-ins to render the audio stream. The plug-in must meet a few requirements:

- Implement the Note Ports and Audio Ports extension.
- Have only 1 MIDI input port and no MIDI output ports.
- Support MIDI dialect.
- Have no audio input ports and only 1 audio output port.
- Have only 2 output channels in stereo configuration.

> [!Important]
> You need to specify location of the CLAP plug-ins on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** preferences page. Any compatible plug-in with extension `.dll` or `.clap` will be added to the player list with a `CLAP` prefix. A CLAP plug-in file can contain multiple plug-in entries.

Here are some examples of CLAP plug-ins:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) | Plug-in modeled on the [Yamaha DX7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7) | ![Working](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-green) |
| [Nuked SC-55 CLAP](https://github.com/johnnovak/Nuked-SC55-CLAP/) | [Roland SC-55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_SC-55) emulator | ![Working](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-green) |
| [Odin 2](https://thewavewarden.com/pages/odin-2/) | 24-voice polyphonic powerhouse | ![Working](https://img.shields.io/badge/working-green) |

## Playing files

To play a supported MIDI file simply add it to foobar2000 playlist and press play.

If the file format is not supported or there's an error in the file an error message will appear in the Playback Error popup and in the foobar2000 console.

### Configuring the output

By default the [LibADLMIDI (Built-in)](#libadlmidi-built-in-fm-synthesis) player is used. You can change the player on the **Playback / Decoding / MIDI Player** page of the foobar2000 Preferences. The **Player** droplist contains all available players.

If you have configured [VSTi](#vsti-vst-instruments-optional) the compatible instruments will added to the list as a player prefixed with `VSTi`. [CLAP](#clap-optional) plug-ins are prefixed with `CLAP`.

The **Configure** button will be enabled if the player has an additional dialog to configure settings specific to that player.

The **Sample rate** combobox allows you to specify the sample rate the player will be asked to create samples. Select any of the predefined values or enter a custom value between 8000Hz and 192000Hz.

> [!Important]
> Some players may ignore this setting because player-specific parameters cause it to render at a higher or lower sample rate. F.e. [FluidSynth](#fluidsynth-optional) may get a different sample rate from a configuration file or [LibMT32EMU](#libmt32emu-mt-32-built-in) will use a different sample rate resulting from a combination its settings. The actual sample rate can be read from the [samplerate](#information-fields) information field.

### Looping

Some MIDI files contain track markers to specify which part of the message stream should be played in a loop. These markers are not part of the Standard MIDI Format standard. If the file does not contain markers foo_midi can also play the entire file in a loop.

The following loop markers are supported:

| Name | Description|
| --- | --- |
| EMIDI&nbsp;/&nbsp;XMI | Used by [EMIDI / XMI](http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/XMI_Format#MIDI_controller_assignments) files with Control Change 116 and 117 as loop markers. This format also can specify the number of times the sequence should be looped. |
| Final&nbsp;Fantasy | Used by Final Fantasy files (starting with [Final Fantasy VII](http://www.midishrine.com/index.php?id=85)) with "loopStart" en "loopEnd" meta events as a marker |
| LeapFrog | Used by [LeapFrog](https://leapfrog.fandom.com/wiki/The_Leap-font_(Music)) files with Control Change 110 and 111 |
| RPG&nbsp;Maker | Used by [RPG Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker) files. Control Change 111 marks the loop start. The loop end is always the end of the stream. |
| Touhou | Used by [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) files with Control Change 2 and 4 |

The component supports 6 loop modes that can be selected in the foobar2000 Preferences dialog:

| Type                            | Description |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Never&nbsp;loop | The song will be played once ignoring any loop information. |
| Never&nbsp;loop.&nbsp;Use&nbsp;decay&nbsp;time | The song will be played once ignoring any loop information with a customizable decay period at the end for the sound to die down. |
| Loop&nbsp;and&nbsp;fade&nbsp;when&nbsp;detected | The song will be played and any defined loop will be repeated a customizable number of times. At the end of the last loop the song will fade out. |
| Loop&nbsp;and&nbsp;fade&nbsp;always | The song will be played and looped a customizable number of times. If no loop is found the complete song be looped. At the end of the last loop the song will fade out. |
| Play&nbsp;indefinitely&nbsp;when&nbsp;detected | The song will be played and the loop, when detected, will play until stopped. |
| Play&nbsp;indefinitely | The song will be played and loop until stopped. |

The **Playback** droplist specifies how loops are processed during normal playback. The **Other** droplist determines how loops are processed during other foobar2000 operations such as converting a MIDI file to another format.

The **Decay time** setting specifies the time in milliseconds that the player will wait before starting to play another track. This allows the last MIDI notes of a stream to decay instead of being abruptly cut when the new track starts playing.

The **Loop count** setting determines how many times a loop will be played before the song ends.

The **Fade-Out time** setting specifies the time in milliseconds that the player will start to fade-out the song before starting to play another track.

### Soundfonts

## Configuring

The settings of foo_midi are spread over different *pages*.

### MIDI Player

 The main preferences page is called **MIDI Player** and can be found in the **Playback / Decoding** section of the Preferences dialog. These settings in general control the playback of MIDI files. Some of the settings have already been explaing in the [Playing files](#playing-files) section.

For an explanation of the loop settings refer to [Looping](#looping).

#### MIDI

You can force a player to start playback using a particular *flavor* of MIDI. The term groups the common MIDI specifications and particular model specific configurations.

> [!Note]
> MIDI files may contain SysEx messages that overrule the flavor you specify.

| Name        | Purpose |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Default     | The player starts playing with its default configuration. Please the consult the player specific documentation for more information. |
| GM          | General MIDI 1 specification. A GM System On SysEx is sent before playback starts. |
| GM2         | General MIDI 2 specification. A GM2 System On SysEx is sent before playback starts. |
| GS&nbsp;SC&#8209;55    | General Sound specification with Roland SC-55 initialization. |
| GS&nbsp;SC&#8209;88    | General Sound specification with Roland SC-88 initialization. |
| GS&nbsp;SC&#8209;88Pro | General Sound specification with Roland SC-88Pro initialization. |
| GS&nbsp;SC&#8209;8820  | General Sound specification with Roland SC-8820 initialization. |
| XG          | Extended General MIDI specification created by Yamaha |

#### Filter effects

This setting prevents reverb and chorus messages from being sent to the player. It does not change the reverb and chorus settings of the player.

#### Use LibMT32Emu with MT-32

When you enable this setting the selected player will be ignored and LibMT32Emu will always be used whenever an MT-32 MIDI file is played.

#### Use VSTi with XG

This setting will ignore the selected player and use the VSTi specified on the **[MIDI Player / Paths](#paths)** page whenever an XG MIDI file is played. Typically the Yamaha S-YXG50 VSTi is configured there.

#### Extra percussion channel

This setting will assign channel 16 as an extra percussion channel whenever a track is found in the MIDI file that contains metadata of type Text, Trackname or Instrumentname that contains the word `drum` (case-insensitive).

#### Exclude unsupported EMIDI track designation

This setting will ignore tracks in an [Apogee Expanded MIDI (EMIDI)](https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/Apogee_Expanded_MIDI) file with Track Designation control change messages (`CC 110`) with unsupported instrument definitions.

#### Disable instrument changes

Enabling this setting will remove all Program Change messages from the MIDI stream.

#### Disable bank changes

Enabling this setting will remove all Control Change bank change messages from the MIDI stream. (`CC 0` and `CC 32`)

### FM Synthesis

This sub-page of **MIDI Player** contains the settings specific to configuring the FM synthesizer-based players.

#### LibADLMIDI

#### LibOPNMIDI

#### LibEDMIDI

#### Nuked OPL3

### Paths

This sub-page of **MIDI Player** contains the various directory and file paths that some of the players require to work.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| VSTi&nbsp;Plug&#8209;Ins | The location of the VSTi plug-ins. The root and all subdirectories will be searched for compatible plug-ins. |
| VSTi&nbsp;XG&nbsp;Plug&#8209;In | The location of the VSTi plug-in that will be used when the [Use VSTi with XG](#use-vsti-with-xg) setting is enabled. |
| CLAP&nbsp;Plug&#8209;Ins | The location of the CLAP plug-ins. The root and all subdirectories will be searched for compatible plug-ins. |
| Sound&nbsp;Font | The location of the soundfont to be used by BASSMIDI and FluidSynth. |
| MT&#8209;32&nbsp;ROMs | The location of the MT-32 ROM files to be used by LibMT32Emu. |
| Secret&nbsp;Sauce | The location of the Secret Sauce library. |
| FluidSynth | The location where the FluidSynth libraries can be found. |
| FluidSynth&nbsp;Config | The location of the FluidSynth configuration file. |

#### HMI / HMP

HMI and HMP file have no way to indicate the tempo at which they should be played. This settings allows you to modify the tempo by entering the number of *beats per minute* (bpm). The default value is 160 bpm.

#### Channels

This setting allows you disable and re-enable any of the 16 MIDI channels per port. Use the *Port&nbsp;number* slider to select the port. Click the button corresponding the channel to disable or re-enable it. These settings become immediately active during playback.

A few shortcut buttons are available to assist in the selection:
